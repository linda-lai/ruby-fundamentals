## Background
Hi, hello and hey! I'm currently a student at Coder Academy completing a Diploma of Information Technology in a full-stack web development immersive bootcamp, learning Ruby for the first time.

The following problems were provided to students to practice Ruby fundamentals, primarily focusing on methods and data structures to build up familiarity with syntax, logic and general programming conventions.

As a newcomer to coding and Ruby, these were challenging but fun exercises to do, particularly as they increased in difficulty - making those ones all the more satisfying to crack!
