# *Problem 17*
# You took a job in Shanghai along with Ruegen working for a financial services company.
# Your boss is Chinese (obviously), a bit of a madman, and dislikes the way the West has 'taken over'.
# He wants you to write a currency exchange method, but each currency must only be compared to the Chinese renminbi.

# Write some methods, each that take a number representing a currency (let's say Thai baht, or Indonesian rupiah, and whatever you like),
# and converts each into the number of Chinese renminbi.

# Now write a method that takes a number, and two strings.

# Using only the methods you have created, code this last method so that you can specify 'from' and 'to' currencies (string arguments), and a number,
# and have this return the relevant exchange.

# For example, you could accept 'vnd' (the Viet dong), 'hkd' (Honky dollar), and a number, and gives the correct exchange for that number given those country parameters.

# Please store I a w-n variable!
